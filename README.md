# members-only
An express node project from The Odin Project that allows students to develop their authentication skills as well as database skills.

Live preview: <a href='https://vast-lowlands-17913.herokuapp.com/'>Members Only</a> (Unfortunately heroku has stopped offering free dyno plans, and thus the live preview, which was hosted by heroku, no longer works until further notice.)

## Introduction
In this project youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
